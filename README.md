# Ryans AI Voice Convos App

## Privacy

This app does not attempt to access or store any sensitive data. It will only ask for Authorization on Sign-Up to limit AI usage using an in-house token system attached to your user

It will clearly define what it's asking to access to identify you as a user when you decide to choose a method of Authorization (Discord, Google, etc)

# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.
